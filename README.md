# FiveSquared

A social media website for a class project where users can post, discuss, and learn about art pieces in various museums, galleries, and private collections around the world.

We implemented a typical social media dynamic of users, following, posts, comments, and badges. We also built a search functionality allowing users to search for and learn more about specific artworks, artists, and the places and collections art is displayed in. The idea is users are able to experience the app in two ways - one in a more interactive way, viewing a curated feed of content the people they follow have posted about various artworks, and another experience where they can search various parameters about artists, museums, and artworks to gather a collection of information and insights others have posted about them.

To enable the most realistic user experience, we fully implemented all planned features of our app including a fully-styled React js frontend and an identity platform allowing users to sign in/out as well as create and edit their own profiles. We also implemented a few specialty pages allowing users to view stats about the platform, visualize the contents of the database, and perform more sophisticated searches.
