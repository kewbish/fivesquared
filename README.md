## Project Summary

Our project is to create a social media website where users can post, discuss, and learn about art in various museums, galleries, and private collections around the world. There will be a typical social media dynamic of users, following, posts, comments, badges, etc as well as a structure around artworks, artists, and the places and collections art is displayed in. The idea is users will be able to experience the app in two ways - one in a more interactive way, viewing a curated feed of content the people they follow have posted about various artworks, and another experience where they can search various parameters about artists, museums, and artworks to gather a collection of information and insights others have posted about them.
