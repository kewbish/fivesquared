## Notes to TA

* Our milestone 1, 2, and 3 submissions are in a folder called milestones. Linked below.
* As was explicitly discussed and approved by our TA, Terry in the Milestone 3 Discussion, we have used some example frontend code from component libraries in the design of our frontend. Some example code was copied from these sources (and extensively modified to fit our project's needs). Sources Below. All backend and SQL code was written exclusively by us based on the project template, with no external code used.
* Github Squash and Merge was used when merging some Pull Requests. As a result, the commit history for some pull requests shows only one commit. Looking in the closed PR's tab will show the incremental commits made during these PR's.

## Project Summary

Our project is to create a social media website where users can post, discuss, and learn about art in various museums, galleries, and private collections around the world. There will be a typical social media dynamic of users, following, posts, comments, badges, etc as well as a structure around artworks, artists, and the places and collections art is displayed in. The idea is users will be able to experience the app in two ways - one in a more interactive way, viewing a curated feed of content the people they follow have posted about various artworks, and another experience where they can search various parameters about artists, museums, and artworks to gather a collection of information and insights others have posted about them.
